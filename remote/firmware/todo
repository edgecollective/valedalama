todo:  

- breadboard the decagon circuit again
- make an analog breakout for the vegetronix



one remote node is: vegetronix + decagon (because requires boost)
which gives two soil moisture sensors and a temp

another remote node is:  two temp probes at different depths
this can be tiny
could even just run on AA batteries maybe
